Gust 1: f=5.7Hz, geometric angle of attack 05 degrees
Gust 2: f=3.2Hz, geometric angle of attack 10 degrees
"deflection" files contain out-of-plane deflections of the wing based on marker measurements.
Wing twist was not investigated!
8 chordwise markers (4 per side) were averaged and smoothed with a sinusoidal fit to yield 15/14 spanwise data points.
The markers were painted on the rib locations and the tip rod. The tip could not be tracked for gust 2.
The sinusoidal fit is conducted in the reference system of the deformed wing so that the spanwise coordinate also varies in time.
The spanwise position corresponding to the deflection measurements are contained in the "coordinates" files.
